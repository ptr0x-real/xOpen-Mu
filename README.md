# xOpen-Mu Project

xOpen Mu is an open source server emulator project of the old game Mu Online.

This project is basically a fork of the xTeam source code (found here: http://forum.ragezone.com/f197/release-team-sources-s4-s6-1098374) which is a season 4/6/8 server emulator project. Additionally the community created a thread gathering known issues and possible fixes (found here: http://forum.ragezone.com/f508/development-zone-bugs-report-files-1098381/).

There is not a clear roadmap yet but I'll be firstly working on a feature to allows server communication with the season 2 game client and later downgrading the active season 4 features to match the features of season 2.

This is the section of files that were not committed to the repository to keep it organized. All the important patch updates from any of each component in this section will be committed to the repository (eg. remember to patch the full client with all the files at ".\_client files\Ex200\" if working on the season 2 version).
